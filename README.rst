About MASER
-----------

The MASER portal (Mesures, Analyses et Simulations dâ€™Emissions Radio) gives an access to tools and database related to low frequency radioastronomy (from few kilohertz up to several tens of megahertz). The radio measurements in the spectral range are realized with ground observatories (for the frequencies above the 10 MHz Earth ionospheric cut-off) or from spacecraft (at lower frequencies).

In this frequency range, the main radio sources are the Sun and the magnetized planets. The low frequency fluctuations measurement of the electric and magnetic fields can also provide a diagnosis on the local plasma conditions, and in-situ observations of plasma waves phenomena in the Solar Wind and the planetary environements.
