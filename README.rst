About maser4py
==============

maser4py python package contains modules to
deal with services, data and tools provided in the framework
of the MASER portal.


Installation
============

Make sure that Python 3.4 (or higher) as well as pip and setuptools are already installed on your system.

The maser4py also requires the NASA CDF software to be run (visit http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/ for more details). Especially the CDFLeapSeconds.txt file
should be on the local disk and reachable from the $CDF_LEAPSECONDSTABLE env. variable. If it is not the case, maser4py offers tools to read and/or download
this file from the NASA Web site (see user manual for more details).

Using pip
---------

From a terminal, enter:

   pip install maser4py

Using Source
------------

From a terminal, enter:

    git clone https://github.com/maserlib/maser4py

Then, from the maser4py directory, enter:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then,

    python3 setup.py install


Usage
=====

From Python, enter "import maser".
The module also offers specific command line interfaces.

For more details, see the maser4py user manual available in the pdf format (in doc/build/latex/maser4py.pdf) or from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maser4py (see in "Package Documentation").

About MASER
===========

The MASER portal (Mesures, Analyses et Simulations dâ€™Emissions Radio) gives an access to tools and database related to low frequency radioastronomy (from few kilohertz up to several tens of megahertz). The radio measurements in the spectral range are realized with ground observatories (for the frequencies above the 10 MHz Earth ionospheric cut-off) or from spacecraft (at lower frequencies).

In this frequency range, the main radio sources are the Sun and the magnetized planets. The low frequency fluctuations measurement of the electric and magnetic fields can also provide a diagnosis on the local plasma conditions, and in-situ observations of plasma waves phenomena in the Solar Wind and the planetary environements.
